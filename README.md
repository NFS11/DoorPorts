# DoorPorts
DoorPorts, a Windows batch file that uses Telnet to check for open ports or test port forwarding on your IP. This tool is still in development, so don't expect it to 100% be successful.

About DoorPorts, how does it work?
DoorPorts uses Telnet with commands in a batchfile to look for open/closed ports on your IP. It can also be used to test port forwarding.

What are the requirements?
You will need Telnet installed and added to path.
You need basically any Windows OS that can run Telnet and commands in a .bat. Really simple.

Will this work?
This is my first project. Do not expect it to 100% work.

Is this safe?
Yes. It doesn't make changes to your PC and merely just runs Telnet commands in order to be able to check for your open ports on your IP.

Please consdier giving me a star, I am still trying to develop.
I make these tools for fun and as a hobby. Enjoy!
